Final evidence for the class: Implementación de métodos computacionales. This program generally consists of highlighting Haskell code in different colors depending on what it is recognized, this program recognizes and puts a different color to each of the 13 different acceptance states from a finite state machine, this acceptance states include the recognition of: variables, reserved words, integers, strings, comments, and special characters. The result is the highlighted Haskell code in an HTML file just like shown in this demo: https://youtu.be/5VeshOgQF7w
